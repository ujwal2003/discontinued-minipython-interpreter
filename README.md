# Discontinued minipython interpreter

This is a incomplete and discontinued interpreter for a minimalist version of python, made for a assignment.  
It will work for only simple things such as variables, lists and printing. Othe features such as if/else and functions
were in progress but never implemented.  

See the *README(submission)* file for details.
