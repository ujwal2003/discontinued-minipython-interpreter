this code must be compiled in the following manner:
 g++ minipython.cpp -o minipython

a dictionary data structure was used for efficient access and storage of identifiers and variables.

Some brief notes on ideas to implement if/else statements and functions:
	IF/ELSE: 
		begin by doing syntax analysis for if and else which would have been done with the following grammar:
			bool_expr 	::= 	(atom|list_acc) "=""=" (atom|list_acc)
							 || (atom|list_acc) ">""=" (atom|list_acc)
							 || (atom|list_acc) "<""=" (atom|list_acc)
							 || (atom|list_acc) ">" (atom|list_acc)
							 || (atom|list_acc) "<" (atom|list_acc)
						
			if_stmt 	::= 	"if" "(" bool_expr ")" ":" || "if" bool_expr ":"
			if_block 	::= 	if_stmt statements STMT_END ENDL
			else_stmt 	::= 	"else" ":"
			else_block 	::= 	else_stmt statements STMT_END ENDL
			
		the main loop would then have checked for an if token and set a flag to let the code know that it was in a "block" (meaning a block of code)
		the boolean expression and each of the statements in the above grammar would have had their own nodes in the AST, upon those nodes being
		created, instead of being put in an AST they would be pushed into a vector of ASTNodes* (hence the flag in main for 'block' so the loop
		won't pass the trees into the interpreter but wait till all the code in the block is gathered). A flag would also be checked for 'else' if
		it were to follow an if statement. Once this block is over, the vector of nodes would be applied into a modifed version of the
		shunting yard algorithm which would return a queue of the nodes in postfix order (with the the if/else being the operators and all other bits
		of code being the operands). This queue would then be passed to a postfix evaluator, with the operands (the constituent lines of code within
		the if/else) being pushed into a stack. If an 'if' was encountered in the queue, and the output queue was empty all the nodes from the stack
		would be popped and a 'ifElseBlockNode' would be created with its left most child being the boolean expression from the ifNode, and its
		middle child would be a list of all the nodes that were popped from the stack, (the right child would be null) this would then be pushed into 
		the output queue. If an 'else' was encountered in the postfix queue all the nodes from the stack would be popped, put into a list, and added as
		the right child of the if node already in the output queue. If multiple other if nodes were encountered, along with all the other nodes in the
		stack, the ifElseBlockNode from the output queue would also be popped and added as a child of a new ifElseBlockNode which would then be pushed
		into the output queue, this way the program deals with nesting. This process is repeated until all items from the postfix queue have been popped.
		I used a very similar process to handle expressions in the code, which can be looked to as an example of how these algorithms can be implemented.
		Upon the completion of this algorithm, the output queue would only have one item in it, this element would be the AST for the if/else statement(s)
		which would then be passed to the interpreter to be interpreted. 
	
	FUCNTIONS:
		parsing and tree creation for the functions would be done in a similar manner to the if/else statement, the tree would contain extra child nodes
		for the function parameters (a new 'return' node type would also have to be created). Once this tree would be passed to the interpreter it would
		create a new 'interpreter instance' (as my Interpreter is a class), the symbol table is outside the class and would hold the 'global variables.'
		A new symbol table would be created for the 'local variables' (i.e. the function paramters and any variables declared inside the function). Once
		this function returns the result would be pushed into the evaluate stack which can then be accessed by the original interpreter instance to attain
		the returned output of the function.
